# Portfolio Website Project - Completed

## Overview

Welcome to my completed Portfolio Website Project! This project is a culmination of my efforts in building a personal portfolio site during the Codecademy course. The website serves as a showcase for the various projects I've undertaken, providing an overview of my skills and achievements in web development.

## Project Objectives

1. **Built a Website:**
   - Utilized HTML and CSS to craft a visually appealing and responsive portfolio site.
   - Showcased a selection of projects on the main page with project details.

2. **Added Interactivity:**
   - Implemented an interactive feature using JavaScript to engage visitors and enhance the user experience.

3. **Version Control:**
   - Employed Git for version control to track changes and manage the project's history systematically.

4. **Command Line and File Navigation:**
   - Utilized the command line for efficient file navigation during the development process.

5. **Local Development:**
   - Developed the portfolio website locally, allowing for thorough testing and seamless iteration.

6. **Web Deployment:**
   - Successfully deployed the site to the web using GitHub Pages, ensuring easy accessibility.

## Prerequisites

Before undertaking this project, I ensured a solid understanding of the following:

- HTML/CSS: Applied knowledge to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.
- JavaScript: Implemented interactive features to enhance the user experience.
- Git and GitHub: Utilized version control for tracking changes and collaboration.

## Challenges Faced

While completing this project, I encountered and overcame several challenges:

1. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensuring the website looked good on various devices required careful consideration of responsive design principles.

2. **JavaScript Implementation:**
   - Integrating an interactive feature with JavaScript presented challenges, but overcoming them enhanced my understanding of client-side scripting.

3. **Git Version Control:**
   - Learning to use Git for version control was initially challenging, but it proved invaluable for managing changes and collaborating effectively.

4. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - Configuring the deployment to GitHub Pages required attention to detail, but the final result made the portfolio easily accessible online.

## Conclusion

This completed Portfolio Website Project not only showcases my technical skills but also represents a significant milestone in my journey as a web developer. I invite you to explore the projects and experiences detailed on the site. Thank you for visiting!
