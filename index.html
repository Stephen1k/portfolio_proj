            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my corner of the digital realm! I'm an open-minded and enthusiastic individual with a deep passion for technology. Currently on the exciting journey of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Infrastructure at the Technological University Dublin, Blanchardstown, I am eager to immerse myself in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
            <p>In my recent role as a Technical Specialist I at Mercedes-Benz in Maastricht, Netherlands, I had the privilege of being part of a dynamic team, providing second-level support to users worldwide. My responsibilities spanned from resolving reported issues and maintaining knowledge management systems to serving as a bridge between Headquarters, Market Performance Centers, retail networks, and other departments. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to identify and solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
            <p>Beyond the world of coding and technology, I find joy in staying active through workouts and boxing, socializing, and spending quality time with friends. My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my learning on Codecademy, consistently working to enhance my programming skills.</p>
